              <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
              <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the eBay Open Source community, as well as steps to
              report unacceptable behavior. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
              <p>We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Although
              we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made
              a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility
              to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>
              <p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor and expect all of the principles in this Code of Conduct to
              apply to any and all interactions within a community that includes, but is not limited to, diversity in age, mental and physical
              ability or disability, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs,
              profession, race, color, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, family status, size, political belief, and technical
              ability. We will not tolerate discrimination or violations of the Code of Conduct based on any aforementioned, or other protected,
              characteristics.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

                <p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong> In founding eBay, Pierre Omidyar started with the premise that “most people are basically good.” As we resolve any open source
                disputes, we request that people consider that as a starting premise about other contributors and community participants,
                and be friendly and patient in all interactions.</p>

                <p><strong>Be welcoming:</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. As an example, consider
                offering assistance or help to people new to the open source community on how to accomplish a coding task.</p>

                <p><strong>Be considerate:</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect
                users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. For example, given that
                we’re a world-wide community, keep in mind that you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language. If it
                seems that is happening, consider how to rephrase or use alternate language to help others in the open source community.</p>

                <p><strong>Be respectful:</strong> Not all of us will agree all of the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
                experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important
                to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Do not insult or put
                down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.</p>

                <p><strong>Try to understand why we disagree:</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we
                resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. If there is a disagreement, search for a compromise that works
                for all parties, and suggest that change. The suggestion may involve offering to do some work, including offering code, or
                other help, for the requested change!</p>

                <p><strong>Remember that we’re different:</strong> The strength of our community comes from its diversity; people from a wide range of backgrounds.
                Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t
                mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus
                on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>

                <h3><strong>Reporting Issues</strong></h3>

                <p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via
                <a href="mailto:open@ebay.com">open@ebay.com</a>. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>

                <p class="textindent">Your contact information.</p>

                <p class="textindent">Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them
                as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record,
                please include a link.</p>

                <p class="textindent">Any additional information that may be helpful.</p>

                <p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions,
                and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse
                themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled
                by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims
                of abuse.</p>

                <h3><strong>Attribution & Acknowledgements</strong></h3>

                <p>We all stand on the shoulders of giants across many open source communities. We’d like to thank the communities and projects
                that established code of conducts and diversity statements as our inspiration, including, but not limited to, the TODO group</p>
